*This is a Portfolio project to display my info and projects I have worked on.

*I made changes to the portfolio item pages for all six projects.

*I added divs outside the picture and new divs below the picture to add links to the website of the specific project and the github repo.

*I added new css code to place the icon which links the project to their site and github repo in the middle under the image and added hover effects.

*I had challenges with making the icons to display inside the image when hovered over.

*The javascript utilised new elements I didn't know before such as a new way to make a functioin. And also the function to go make the bar appear when pressing the burger icon.
